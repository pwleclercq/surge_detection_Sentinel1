Google Earth Engine (GEE) code for global detection of glacier surge activity as published in P.W. Leclercq, A.M. K채채b, B. Altena, Brief Communication: Detection of glacier surge activity using cloud computing of Sentinel-1 radar data, The Cryosphere (2021)

Code can be copied in the GEE code editor https://code.earthengine.google.com/. This requires a GEE user account. Running the code gives the 2018-2019 NDI images, both complete and masked with the GLIMS glacier outlines, the maximum backscatter images for 2018 and 2019, and the Sentinel-2 optical images from summer 2019. Changing polarization from VH to HV will give better coverage in the high latitude regions. Locations of detected surge-activity as presented in the paper (Table S1) are included as well.
